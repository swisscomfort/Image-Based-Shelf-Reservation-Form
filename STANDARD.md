# Image-Based Shelf Reservation Form (IBSRF)

## 1. Purpose

This form defines a comparable and auditable method for time-based reservation of physical shelf space using image-based documentation.

## 2. Scope

This form applies wherever physical products are placed on shelves and subject to temporary reservation or prioritization.

Product value, price, brand, or sales performance are explicitly excluded.

## 3. Core Rules

### 3.1 Image-Based Evidence

Each reservation must be based on at least one image showing the relevant shelf section with clearly identifiable reserved products.

### 3.2 Image–Time Binding

Each image must be explicitly assigned to the time period it represents.

### 3.3 Product Segmentation

Each reserved product must be treated as an independent, non-overlapping segment within the image.

### 3.4 Area Measure

For each segment, an area-based measure must be determined.

The measurement method may be freely selected but must be:
- documented,
- consistently applied,
- reproducible.

### 3.5 Time Reference

Each reservation must be bound to a clearly defined time period.

### 3.6 Value Derivation

Reservation value must be derived exclusively from:

Area × Time

No other factors are permitted.

## 4. Comparability Rule

Two reservations are comparable if and only if the following elements are documented and equivalent:

- image basis,
- segmentation logic,
- area measurement method,
- time reference.

## 5. Documentation Requirement

The following materials must be retained and reproducible upon request:

- image material,
- segment definitions,
- area measurement documentation,
- time period definition.

## 6. Boundary

This form defines:

- no software,
- no technology,
- no exclusivity,
- no quality rating,
- no pricing mechanism.

No implicit or explicit extensions beyond this boundary are permitted.
